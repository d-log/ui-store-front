      Forms and styles
      This section describes the different forms and styles of essay writing. These forms and styles are used by an
      array of authors, including university students and professional essayists.

      Cause and effect
      The defining features of a "cause and effect" essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect,
      careful language, and chronological or emphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the
      subject, determine the purpose, consider the audience, think critically about different causes or consequences,
      consider a thesis statement, arrange the parts, consider the language, and decide on a conclusion.[6]

      Classification and division
      Classification is the categorization of objects into a larger whole while division is the breaking of a larger
      whole into smaller parts.[7]

      Compare and contrast
      Compare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison, points of comparison, and analogies. It
      is grouped by the object (chunking) or by point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between
      two or more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between two or more objects. When writing
      a compare/contrast essay, writers need to determine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and
      points of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the comparison, and reach a conclusion.
      Compare and contrast is arranged emphatically.[8]

      Descriptive
      Descriptive writing is characterized by sensory details, which appeal to the physical senses, and details that
      appeal to a reader's emotional, physical, or intellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the
      audience, creating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the description are the
      rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A description is usually arranged spatially but can also
      be chronological or emphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description uses tools such as denotative
      language, connotative language, figurative language, metaphor, and simile to arrive at a dominant impression.[9]
      One university essay guide states that "descriptive writing says what happened or what another author has
      discussed; it provides an account of the topic".[10] Lyric essays are an important form of descriptive essays.

      Dialectic
      In the dialectic form of the essay, which is commonly used in philosophy, the writer makes a thesis and argument,
      then objects to their own argument (with a counterargument), but then counters the counterargument with a final
      and novel argument. This form benefits from presenting a broader perspective while countering a possible flaw that
      some may present. This type is sometimes called an ethics paper.[11]

      Exemplification
      An exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant, representative, and believable
      examples including anecdotes. Writers need to consider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their
      audience, decide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing an exemplification
      essay.[12]


      Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population
      Familiar
      An essayist writes a familiar essay if speaking to a single reader, writing about both themselves, and about
      particular subjects. Anne Fadiman notes that "the genre's heyday was the early nineteenth century," and that its
      greatest exponent was Charles Lamb.[13] She also suggests that while critical essays have more brain than the
      heart, and personal essays have more heart than brain, familiar essays have equal measures of both.[14]

      History (thesis)
      A history essay sometimes referred to as a thesis essay describes an argument or claim about one or more
      historical events and supports that claim with evidence, arguments, and references. The text makes it clear to the
      reader why the argument or claim is as such.[15]

      Narrative
      A narrative uses tools such as flashbacks, flash-forwards, and transitions that often build to a climax. The focus
      of a narrative is the plot. When creating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their
      audience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the narrative. A narrative is usually arranged
      chronologically.[16]

      Argumentative
      An argumentative essay is a critical piece of writing, aimed at presenting objective analysis of the subject
      matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The main idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of
      positive or negative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and analysis, strong internal logic
      and sharp structure. Its structure normally builds around introduction with a topic's relevance and a thesis
      statement, body paragraphs with arguments linking back to the main thesis, and conclusion. In addition, an
      argumentative essay may include a refutation section where conflicting ideas are acknowledged, described, and
      criticized. Each argument of argumentative essay should be supported with sufficient evidence, relevant to the
      point.

      Economic
      An economic essay can start with a thesis, or it can start with a theme. It can take a narrative course and a
      descriptive course. It can even become an argumentative essay if the author feels the need. After the
      introduction, the author has to do his/her best to expose the economic matter at hand, to analyze it, evaluate it,
      and draw a conclusion. If the essay takes more of a narrative form then the author has to expose each aspect of
      the economic puzzle in a way that makes it clear and understandable for the reader

      Reflective
      A reflective essay is an analytical piece of writing in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene,
      event, interaction, passing thought, memory, or form — adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the topic in
      the author's life. Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn’t just describe the situation, but
      revisits the scene with more detail and emotion to examine what went well, or reveal a need for additional
      learning — and may relate what transpired to the rest of the author's life.

      Other logical structures
      The logical progression and organizational structure of an essay can take many forms. Understanding how the
      movement of thought is managed through an essay has a profound impact on its overall cogency and ability to
      impress. A number of alternative logical structures for essays have been visualized as diagrams, making them easy
      to implement or adapt in the construction of an argument
